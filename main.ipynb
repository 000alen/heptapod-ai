Consequences for Noncompliance with Requirements  In addition to the usual fees set forth in the section on Financial Information and the disciplinary sanctions noted above, the following ﬁnes and fees may be imposed on students who fail to meet important requirements and deadlines. Most fees or ﬁnes are imposed because a student has either failed to meet a requirement and/or failed to communicate regarding requirements established in the Prepare process, the Enrollment and Housing Commitment, the Student Handbook, pre-departure materials, Residential Agreements, and other published policies. Fines may be imposed for additional policy violations and increased for multiple oﬀenses. Fines may also be coupled with the imposition of another sanction, like oﬃcial warnings, account holds, suspension or expulsion.  5.14.1 Fees and Fines for Noncompliance  The following is not an exhaustive list. Other ﬁnes, fees or consequences may ﬂow from student conduct that does not meet published policies.  5.14.1.1. Not attending essential Foundation Week/Elevation sessions or make-up session Foundation Week and Elevation dates are published far enough in advance for all students to plan accordingly. Make-up work will never be the same as being in attendance. Therefore, students who do not attend Foundation Week or Elevation are required to attend make-up sessions and/or do make-up work on material that was missed to demonstrate that they understand the essential material. Should a student fail to complete this, the student will receive an account hold and be unable to gain access to the next Prepare process until doing so.  5.14.1.2.
